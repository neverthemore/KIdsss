  Description: "This sample includes a series of self contained and small Scenes
    that you can use to familiarize yourself with the essentials of working with
    coherence.\n\nThe included Scenes cover:\n\n\t\u2022 Synchronizing a capsule
    movement.\n\t\u2022 How to distribute authority of entities across the current
    network session.\n\t\u2022 Synchronizing rigidbodies in a very simple physics
    simulation.\n\t\u2022 How to use entity persistence.\n\nScenes are numbered in
    ascending difficulty, so we recommend starting with the 1_CharacterMovement Scene
    and work it up from there."
