  Description: 'The First Steps project is a series of small sample scenes, each
    one demonstrating one or more features of coherence.


    If you''re a first
    time user, we suggest to go through the scenes in the established order. They
    will guide you through some key coherence and networking concepts.


    Remember
    that playing the scenes on your own only shows part of the picture. To fully
    experience the networked aspects, you have to play them in the Editor plus one
    or more built instances, and even better - with other people.
